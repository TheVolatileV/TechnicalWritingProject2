To be able to develop programs in Java through Intellij, a few different programs are needed.

Download and Install Intellij
===============

Javadocs are available in both jar format and web format.
The jar format is available on the `Promoted Downloads <https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/releases>`_ page or on any of the build pages of the `Beta Downloads <http://home.dv8tion.net:8080/job/JDA/>`_.

`Latest Promoted Docs <http://home.dv8tion.net:8080/job/JDA/Promoted%20Build/javadoc/>`_

The web format allows for viewing of the `Latest Promoted Docs`_ and also viewing of each individual build’s javadoc. To view the javadoc for a specific build, you will need to go to that build’s page on `the build server`_ and click the javadoc button on the left side of the build page.
A shortcut would be: http://home.dv8tion.net:8080/job/JDA/BUILD_NUMBER_GOES_HERE/javadoc/, you just need to replace the “BUILD\_NUMBER\_GOES\_HERE” with the build you want.
Example: Build 264’s javadoc url would be http://home.dv8tion.net:8080/job/JDA/264/javadoc/
